# hashlib++

### Overview

This is a small, standalone hashing library for C++ written by
Benjamin Gr√ºdelbach. It has a fairly permissive license. I
downloaded it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hashlib2plus/
and converted it to use cmake.

See the original [README.TXT](doc/README.TXT) for more information.

### Future Enhancements
* Add cmake config files to the installation
* Test/fix on Windows
* Test/fix against Android
* Test/fix against different Linux distributions
* Provide cmake HOWTO info here
